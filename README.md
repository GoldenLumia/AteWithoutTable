# AteWithoutTable
This is a fork of You've Never Eaten Without a Table updated to 1.4. I am not the original author of this mod. 

This fork moves the code to a patch instead of a replacement. This allows it to function more easily with the base game and other mods without weird things happening. 

Should weird things happen, please leave a comment.

=== original description ===
This mod currently just removes the debuff to "ate without a table" thought. In the future I hope to a buff to eating on a table instead.
